# PageRank

This project is a simple implementation of Page Rank algorithm, using C.

## Usage
Clone the repo:
```Bash
git clone git@github.com:joshhauser/PageRank.git
```

Compile the program:
```Bash
make
```

Execute the program, with or without args:
- with args:
```Bash
./pagerank <graph path> <max_iterations> <damping factor>
```
> Note that most of the time, `0.85` is recommanded for damping factor.

- vithout args:
```Bash
./pagerank # default parameters are hard coded 
```

### Output
3 output files are created by this program. Their paths are hard coded!
- `output/normalized_graph.txt`: contains the "normalized graph" data, i.e. list of orderly vertices labels
- `output/matrix.txt`: contains the transition matrix
- `output/eigen_vector.txt`: contains the eigen vector generated by PageRank algorithm
